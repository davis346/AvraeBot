## Usage

Monster Generator Tab
Generate Monster is used for adding monsters to the combat. You can change the name, add multiple monsters of the same type, and many other options when starting initiative.

Health Options Tab
Allows you to heal or damage a monster during combat. There is also a kill monster command for when you want to take them out of initiative.

Skills & Saves
Allows you to roll skill checks or saving throws for a monster. Simply choose either the saving throw or skill check option to allow the respective buttons appear. Each time you want to select a different check or save press the respective button. There is also a Reroll section if you need to do a check or save multiple times for the same monster. Setting a DC is another option that will allow the bot to tell you if the monster passed or failed.
